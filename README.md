# delphi-actuator-sensor
Replacement position sensor PCB for VAG/Porsche/Delphi HVAC actuators commonly used on the Porsche 955/9PA Cayenne, VW 7L Touareg, and perhaps Audi Q7. The original Alps resistive sensor usually fouls due to excessive grease application from the factory and appears to be a custom 4.7kOhm, 120 degree part that isn't purchasable. The closest sensor is the RDC503052A in the same mechanical package but it does not match the original electrical angle. This project matches the output of that sensor to the original range.

The connector pin spacing is 2.85mm and the pin headers used here are 2.54mm. Suggest soldering these on yourself as they need to be flush with the board and you can then tweak them as necessary to fit in the existing housing.
